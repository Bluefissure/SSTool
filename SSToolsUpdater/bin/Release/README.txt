Q: Why can't I use this in the Aesthetician?
A.) There's a chance some modified data could be sent back to Square, which could potentially result in a ban.

Q:  A new patch just came out and my Trainer doesn't work. Help!
A.) New patches can sometimes (usually) break the trainer - wait patiently for an update to fix it.

Q: How do we do the fancy Animation/Edited Emotes in /gpose!?
A.) First things first, do an emote outside of gpose such as /yes. This also means everyone else you're gposing with, if you wish to edit them as well! Then, in the trainer tool, freeze the Emote then edit the ID or search for an emote you would want to change it to. Putting the ID as 30 will make the player's animation to sprint. After changing the ID, press space bar in-game to change/reset the pose.

Q: How can we access NPC appearances in /gpose!?
A.) You can access NPC appearances very easily although tricky! It is recommended to have Trainer Always-on-Top or ready to alt tab. Make sure you got your NPC edits ready! As you proceed to go in gpose, during load time or before entering gpose press the [NPC REFRESH] button swiftly as possible to have NPC appearances in gpose! Sometimes your character will be cloned. Sometimes not!

Q: Can I get banned for using this tool!?
A1.) Yes, in matter of fact you can get banned for using this tool! But how!? Well as long as you don't talk about this program in-game and doing edits n' so forth you will be fine. However talking about this tool in-game will result you in possible suspension. Don't talk about this tool as you would with Parsing, Cheat Engine and Modding!

A2.) All modifications are client side only, which means that the changes will not be visible to Square. The only exception is the Aesthetician, which could possibly send some of your modified data to Square. This is why we highly suggest not using this tool while in the Aesthetician. In addition, like any other tool, you should avoid talking about it ingame.
